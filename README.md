This app allows you to register/login into your account and share your secret (one secret per account) anonymously. Google and Facebook Sign-In is also integrated into this website. Once you submit your secret every other user can see it.

This project was part of my educational track on security and authentication. It uses passport and OAuth. Each password is stored encrypted in a database (MongoDB) using hashing and salting.

It is suggested to run this project locally using http://localhost:3000/
